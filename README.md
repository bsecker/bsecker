I am a DevSecOps Engineer, living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I am currently working at [EthonAI](https://ethon.ai), working on Kubernetes/DevOps in a fast-paced AI startup environment.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on ...** Various custom things for personal finanancing.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning ...** Godot, Go, Machine Learning, whatever takes my fancy. Also Kubernetes is a never-ending rabbit hole :-)
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about ...** My personal wiki, and the tools I've written to manage it! Also, I love talking about my [honours thesis](https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/report/Development_of_an_IoT_System_for_Environmental_Monitoring_Software/13557857) - a NBIoT based system for environmental monitoring.
